# Firebase Authentication in ReactJS

Welcome to the Firebase Authentication in React.js project repository! This project provides a comprehensive guide on setting up Firebase Authentication with Google, Facebook, GitHub, and Phone in a React.js application.

## Introduction
Firebase Authentication simplifies the process of authenticating users in web applications by offering seamless integration with popular authentication providers. This project demonstrates how to implement Firebase Authentication in a React.js application, enabling users to sign in using their Google, Facebook, GitHub, or phone credentials.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2. Basic understanding of React.js and creating React applications.
3. A Firebase project created in the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/).
